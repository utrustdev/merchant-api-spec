  summary: Creates a refund proposal
  description: >-
    As a merchant you can only propose refunds, it's ultimately the buyer's
    decision to either accept or reject it (within a reasonable timeframe).
    There can only be one refund proposed per payment.For payments older than 3 months, refund is not allowed.
